# About
I was writing a feature for another program to dither an image and set up a separate project for easier testing, and then made it into command line tool that is a bit more complete for running dithering algorithms on images.

# Dithering

Dithering is the process of adding noise to an image. 
There are 2 approaches:
  - Error diffusion dithering: A quantization error (the difference between the old pixel and the new pixel) is distributed to nearby neighbours of a pixel that haven't been processed yet (e.g. Floyd-Steinberg Dithering)
  - Ordered dithering: Uses a pre-calculated threshold map to determine how to quantize it each pixel in the image. (e.g. Bayer Dithering).

## Floyd-Steinberg

One of the most well known is the Floyd-Steinberg image dithering algorithm. The algorithm itself is quite simple. You scan from left to right, top to bottom, and distribute the "error" from the pixel being processed to it's closest unprocessed pixels.

``` FSharp
// process pixels starting from the top left of the image
// process in order from left to right, top to bottom
for y in 0 .. bitmap.Height - 1 do
    for x in 0 .. bitmap.Width - 1 do
        let oldPixel = bitmap.GetPixel(x, y)
        let newPixel = findClosestPaletteColor oldPixel
        bitmap.SetPixel(x, y, newPixel)
        let quantError = difference oldPixel newPixel

        // distribute the "error" to neighbouring unvisited pixels
        // to the right, bottom left, below, and bottom right pixel
        [ x + 1,  y,      7.0 / 16.0
          x - 1,  y + 1,  3.0 / 16.0
          x,      y + 1,  5.0 / 16.0
          x + 1,  y + 1,  1.0 / 16.0 ]
        |> List.iter (fun (x, y, factor) -> addError bitmap x y quantError factor)
```

Below is a few examples of images I dithered using Floyd-Steinberg dithering. Different methods are available for selecting the pixel colors for dithering (usually some colour pallet of a few common colours), but for what I wanted black-and-white dithering was perfect.

### Other Error Diffusion Algorithms

There are many other error dithering algorithms based on the same technique as used in Floyd-Steinberg.
 - Atkinson - A variant of Floyd-Steinberg that diffuses Â¾ of the quantization error to neighbours. Preserving detail better, but at the cost of performance to near-white or near-black areas. 
 - Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke independently came up with the same error diffusion dithering, but diffused the quantization error to a wider range of neighbours. 
 - Sierra, using diffusing the error over 2 rows.
 - And more with pros and cons to the output and performance.
